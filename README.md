Some project ideas to get this topic moving:

Open spider/crawl data standard, so that you don't have to re-crawl with every proxy or dynamic security tool you use (tools that support the standard could import and export crawl data to each other)
Help with the Python Security project
Help edit (or create) new items in the Cheat Sheet series
Update various parts of the ESAPI
